# Surveyr App

Collect data anytime, anywhere — even offline!

**Surveyr App** is a companion to **Surveyr**, an open-source form builder designed for creating engaging surveys, questionnaires, quizzes, and polls.

This app enables you to collect responses to your forms offline. All responses are stored locally on your device and then sync the data when you're back online.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Install the latest version of **Node.js** and **npm**, in this project we are using Node.js v22.13.1 and npm v10.9.2 respectively.
2. Install the Cordova CLI by running `npm install -g cordova`.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `cordova prepare`, this will install all the necessary dependencies and plugins required for the project.


### ⚠️ Note
This is an alpha version serving as a proof of concept, not a fully-featured application. Built using **Cordova**.

### 🚧 Current Limitations
- The app currently supports only non-live forms. It cannot cache dynamic data fetched from the server in real time.
